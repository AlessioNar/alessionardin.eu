My master thesis explores whether AI should be considered both as a General Purpose Technology and a
research tool that can itself be used to increase the rate of innovation, also defined in the literature as a General Method
of Invention. After a historical and conceptual introduction of the mechanics of AI and a presentation
of the institutions that regulate innovations (IPRs), the work focus on the impact of AI
on innovation, both through a qualitative analysis of the different ways and in which AI can be deployed and
through the deployment of traditional and new indicators to detect GPTs in patent data.

The publication can be downloaded from [Ca' Foscari University open repository](http://dspace.unive.it/handle/10579/19003), while the code used to perform the analysis can be accessed in [my github profile](https://github.com/AlessioNar/MyThesis).
