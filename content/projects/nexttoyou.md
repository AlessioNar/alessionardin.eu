While I was working at the Veneto Region, I was part of the [Next to You](https://www.ensa-network.eu/nexttoyou) project, which supports the integration of minors and young adults victims of human trafficking during their migration journey towards the European Union.

My role in the project involved:
- participating to transnational meetings
- agreeing on a common brand image of the project
- developing and updating the project website according to the project's needs

I started cooperating on the project on 22 mar 2021 and the project is planned to close in november.
