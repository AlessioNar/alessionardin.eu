While I was working at the Veneto Region, I was part of the [FORM](https://www.ensa-network.eu/formproject) project, which supports the integration of minors and young adults victims of human trafficking during their migration journey towards the European Union.

My role in the project involved:
- participating to transnational meetings
- developing a brand image of the project
- full-stack development as a Django app

I started cooperating on the project on  and the project is ongoing.
