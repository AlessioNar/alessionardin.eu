[ENSA](https://www.ensa-network.eu) is the web portal of the ENSA network, which hosts information of the network's activities, projects and partners.

I wrote this web application in python using the Django Framework. Since the launch of this portal (april 2021), it hosts the websites of three other projects [Next To You](/projects/nexttoyou), [FORM](/projects/formproject) and [Cognition & Inclusion](https://www.ensa-network.eu/cognitioninclusion/index.html).
