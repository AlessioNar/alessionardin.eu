My first web application written in Go. The complete source code can be found in [this repository](https:/github.com/AlessioNar/bookings)

- Built in Go version 1.17
- Uses the [chi router](github.com/go-chi/chi)
- Uses [alex edwards scs session management](github.com/alexedwards/scs)
- Uses [nosurf](github.com/justinas/nosurf)
