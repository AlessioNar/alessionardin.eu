      <description>My master thesis explores whether AI should be considered both as a General Purpose Technology and a research tool that can itself be used to increase the rate of innovation, also defined in the literature as a General Method of Invention. After a historical and conceptual introduction of the mechanics of AI and a presentation of the institutions that regulate innovations (IPRs), the work focus on the impact of AI on innovation, both through a qualitative analysis of the different ways and in which AI can be deployed and through the deployment of traditional and new indicators to detect GPTs in patent data.</description>
